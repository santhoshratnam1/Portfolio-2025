## Lessons Learned

### System-First Approach

Investing in robust technical systems early (modular encounter components, VFX manager, procedural tools, custom editor tools) provided exponential returns throughout development. This reinforced the importance of technical infrastructure over ad-hoc content creation.

### VFX as Gameplay Communication

Learning HLSL and shader programming opened possibilities for visual communication beyond aesthetics. Discovered that VFX serve critical gameplay functions: guiding players, indicating state, providing feedback, and supporting tactical decisions.

### Encounter Design Psychology

Designing encounters that were simultaneously challenging and fair required extensive playtesting. Small adjustments (enemy timing, visual cues, hazard placement) dramatically improved experience. Understanding player psychology and decision-making patterns became essential to encounter design.

### Data-Driven Iteration

Collecting quantitative playtesting data (completion metrics, decision points, confusion areas) provided objective insights guiding design decisions. This data-driven approach proved more effective than intuition-based design.

### Performance-Conscious Development

Optimizing VFX and systems throughout development rather than as final step maintained smooth performance and prevented costly rework. This proactive optimization mindset became standard practice for future episodes.
